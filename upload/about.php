                <h5>BEAU GOOREY BIO</h5>
              <p>Introduced to collecting early on by his father, a GIA certified jewelry dealer, Beau always knew that his true calling was in the world of vintage watches.  After years of collecting as a hobby and working in various other industries, Beau’s professional horological journey started over 15 years ago as he began working on restoring his own watches.  Largely self taught, Beau quickly realized that his skills were in much demand and opened an independent service center in downtown Los Angeles.  There he further honed his skills in vintage watch case refinishing and repair and earned the reputation as one of the best in the industry.</p>

                <h5>ERIC KU BIO</h5>
              <p>Eric has been in love with watches since a very young age.  For nearly 20 years, he has been involved in the field of horology as both a vintage watch dealer and a subject matter expert.  A recognized expert in the industry, Eric has been quoted in and written about in both industry and mainstream publications.  Realizing the lack of restoration and servicing options available to collectors and dealers, he collaborated with Beau to found Los Angeles Watchworks in 2016 to cater to the particular needs of discerning collectors and retailers alike.</p>
