          		<h5>MOVEMENT RESTORATION</h5>
              <p>Like any finely tuned automobile, watches require regular service and maintenance to insure their optimal performance.  Los Angeles Watchworks can provide factory level servicing for any of your timepieces to insure continued accuracy and performance.  Our technicians and watchmakers will carefully disassemble, clean, service and repair or replace any needed parts before carefully reassembling movements and insuring optimal performance.</p>
              <p>Our work is warranted for a period of one year from any defects in our workmanship.</p>

          		<h5>CASE RESTORATION</h5>
              <p>We specialize in case restoration.  Whether it’s a beat up Royal Oak Offshore that needs the bezel cleaned up, a well worn Rolex case that needs a detail to give it that extra “POP”, or a watch that was previously poorly refinished that needs to be brought back to factory spec,  Los Angeles Watchworks is the place to send your piece.  All work is done under the careful eye of our founder Beau Goorey, and follows the simple principle of making watches “Look the way they should”.  Done in conjunction with a movement overhaul or by itself, we will carefully inspect your timepiece and let you know what we can do to bring out its beauty.  </p>

              <p>Do the hands on your watch not match?  Are you looking to swap a crystal or maybe change dials?  At Los Angeles Watchworks, we are happy to accommodate requests from collectors for small or odd jobs.  You will rest easy knowing that these sometimes small but crucial jobs are being handled by experts.</p>
